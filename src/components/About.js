            <p>
                I recently graduated from the University of Florida with a Bachelors in Computer Science-Digital Arts and Sciences. I had a great time learning everything from data structures to design principles, but I think I’ll miss my a cappella group the most!
            </p>
            <p>
                If I have some spare time, I love playing games with my friends and walking my dog. Games mean a lot to me, and they’re my favorite way of getting to know people. Feel free to challenge me to a game of chess any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I have a lot of spare time, my hobbies are cosplay, making art, and game development. Whether it’s creating a cool costume or a neat game idea, it’s really satisfying when one of my ideas comes to life.
